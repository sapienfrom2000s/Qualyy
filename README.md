I have skipped the nested attributes form as I have forgotten some of it and it would require some
time to relearn it.

# TDD

I have been slacking to write TDD from past 5-6 projects. It has been atleast 5 months since I learned about
TDD. It always felt like a waste of time to focus on tests and then on development. The projects always forced
me to write tests. I had to write them after writing the code. It was painful.

Turning Point:

When I was doing social media clone. I read a article which gave some arguments on favour of Testing. One of the points
that hit me hard was 'Code can't be written perfectly on the first time. You need to refactor it to improve the quality.
And you need tests to make sure that you didn't break anything'.

Advantages of TDD(opinion):

Writing Tests first helps to break the logic. It forces you to think only in terms of passing that test. So,
you form the logic to just pass the test.

It's fun. It feels like playing a game.
